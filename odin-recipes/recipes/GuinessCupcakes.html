        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder, or more to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup Irish stout beer (such as Guinness®)</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>½ cup cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups sifted confectioners' sugar, or more as needed</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 12-cup
          muffin tins or line cups with paper liners.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whisk stout beer, milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract together in
          a bowl until evenly blended. Beat in eggs 1 at a time, beating well
          after each addition. Mix in sour cream. Whisk together flour, sugar,
          cocoa powder, and baking soda in a separate bowl. Gradually mix the
          flour mixture ingredients into the beer mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spoon cupcake batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4
          full.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven until cupcakes are risen and set in the
          middle but still soft and tender, about 25 minutes. Cool in the tins,
          then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, about 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whisk cocoa powder and stout beer together in a bowl. Beat in butter
          and cream cheese using an electric mixer until well combined.
          Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar, 1 cup at a time, until
          frosting has desired sweetness. Spread or pipe frosting onto cooked
          cupcakes.
        </li>
      </ol>
